		Test Next Generation

Dependency - Library or Jar file(which contains prebuilt functions)
vs
Plugin - Is a software or tool i.e is used to run the code in our required environmentS


1.Test Ng return type is always void
2.TestNg is used to run multiple at the same time
3.Test Ng Types : Sequential, Parallel Execution
4.Thread Count: Can specify how many threads should work at same time
	for eg: we have (i) Test case = 2 & Threads = 2 => Run both case at same time
				(ii)Test Case = 1 & Threads =1 => Two cases run one by one

5.Test annotation according to the ascii value Order
	for eg: Apple run first & apple run second
	syntax: @Test
			public void methodName(){}

6.Priority Attribute
	it tells which function to be executed first according to the interger value given to priority
	syntax: @Test(priority = 1)

7.DependsOnMethods Attribute
	(i)It works according to the successfull execution of method given in dependsOnMethod
	syntax: @Test("MethodName");=> for same class
	syntax: @Test("PackageName.ClassName.MethodName");=> for from other package 
	(ii)DependsOnMethod has more priority than priority Attribute.

8.Invoication Count Attribute
	(i)it specifies no of time the test run to iterate
Invocation Timeout Attribute
	(i)it tells how much time the total iteration should take 
	(ii)if the test couldnt run in specified milliSecond then failure could occur
	(iii)Timout doesnt work without count.

9.Exceptions in selenium
	(i)

10.Methods in testRun:
	Description Attribute- Text to be displayed at test case result
	always run Attribute- it make the function run even it the dependsonMethod fails
	enabled Attribute`- enable false make the method invisible from the test run

11.ThreadPoolSize Attribute - it is same as thread cout i.e how many threads to use at same time
	Timeout Attribute - how much time to take for in a single run test case
					it runs without invoication count
	ExpectedException Attribute - We can give our needed exception even we are facing any other problem in the function

12.Parameter Annotiation
	(i)it is used to pass value from xml file to the required package/class
	(ii)it should run using test suite
	(iii)Cross browser test using two browser
13.data provider
	(i)Can send dyanamic array values by passing the dataprovider name to other function
	(ii)can pass data from other class by inheriting the class.
	(iii)Inherit data from other class using extends (or) by using dataProviderClass
